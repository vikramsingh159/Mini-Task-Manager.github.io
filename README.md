Assignment Web Panel (Mini-Task Manager) (React.js)

The mini-task manager should have elements to perform the following tasks:
● Create task
● Assign a task to a user
● Update Task
● Delete task
● View task based on the date and priority (High medium-low)
● Being able to drag and drop task from one priority to another
Additional points for implementing:
● Real-Time Search bar: Don’t need API for that
